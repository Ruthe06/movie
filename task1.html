        <p><b> Saba Nayagan </b> Movie Review: Saba Nayagan is the latest addition to the already long list of <br>
            films that revolve around a man and <i>the women</i> he falls in love with at different stages of his
            life.,<br>
            It has to be said that a film like this cannot be judged by the <u> story it tells </u>, but rather by how
            <br>
            it chooses to tell that particular story. CS Karthikeyan, in his debut feature, tells that story in an
            outwardly <br>
            familiar format but successfully incorporates interesting laugh-out-loud moments into the mix. <br>
            The film would not have had half of its impact if not for some of its quick-witted one-liners. <br>
            Even when long stretches do not work, all of a sudden, one of the characters cracks ,<br>
            a smart jokethat drags you back into what's going on. It also has to be noted that most of the film’s
            effective
            <br> <u>jokes are </u>told by the protagonist Aravind/Saba’s <del>(Ashok Selvan)</del> friends. <br>
            Similar to most films in this genre, the film is as much about Aravind’s friendships <br>
            as it is about the women he loves. <cite>But on </cite> hand, while Saba Nayagan succeeds in <br>
            effectively portraying the friendship aspect of the protagonist’s life, Aravind's <br>
            love life pales in comparison. But<mark>Karthika Muralidharan </mark> as Aravind’s school crush <br>
            Esha commands the screen with her arresting presence.<br>
            Luckily, the film is self-aware in its approach and doesn’t take itself too seriously by<br>
            shifting its tonal gears to drama <kbd>to prove a point</kbd>. Saba Nayagan is a comedy, and the film <br>
            never forgets that fact and also makes sure that we, the audience, also don’t forget this. <br>
            A mother being disappointed by her son or friends sharing an emotional hug at a farewell <br>
            or the heartbreaks of Aravind and his friends—none of it is prolonged, and some of these moments <br>
            are played for laughs rather than emotional sentiments.
            Speaking of the cast, Jaiseelan Sivaram, Arun Kumar, <br>
            and Sriram Krish are hilarious as the protagonist’s friends. As the protagonist, <br>
            Ashok Selvan is effective, as he holds together the film with admirable nonchalance. <br>
            All said and done, Saba Nayagan is a film that thrives on relatability and references, <br>
            if not anything else.
